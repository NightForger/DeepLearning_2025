        "**Goal:** Understand the inner workings of the Transformer architecture for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. We will explore tokenization, embeddings, positional encoding, self-attention (encoder & decoder), cross-attention, and how these components fit together.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach:** We will use a combination of theoretical explanations, visualizations, and hands-on code examples. We will leverage the Hugging Face `transformers` library to inspect a pre-trained model and also implement key components from scratch using PyTorch to solidify understanding. We will **not** be training a model, but rather dissecting an existing one.\n",

        "3. **Subword-Based:** The sweet spot! Breaks words into smaller, meaningful units. Common words remain intact, rare words are broken down. Handles OOV gracefully and keeps vocabulary size manageable.\n",
        "    * **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):** Starts with characters, iteratively merges most frequent pairs. Used by GPT, RoBERTa.\n",
        "        * **Byte-Level BPE (BBPE):** A variant of BPE that operates directly on the raw bytes of the input text rather than on characters. This approach enhances robustness since it can efficiently handle any Unicode string, including rare symbols and diverse languages. It is famously used in models like GPT-2.\n",
        "    * **WordPiece:** Similar to BPE, but merges pairs that maximize likelihood of training data. Used by BERT, DistilBERT.\n",

        "**Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** This is the building block.\n",
