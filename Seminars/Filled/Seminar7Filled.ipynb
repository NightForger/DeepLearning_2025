        "\n",
        "For training models with **Contrastive Loss**, we need pairs of data points:\n",
        "* **Positive Pairs:** Items that are considered similar or duplicates.\n",
        "* **Negative Pairs:** Items that are considered dissimilar or non-duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "While creating positive pairs is usually straightforward (e.g., based on a 'true' duplicate ID, if available, or manually defined rules), generating effective *negative* pairs is crucial for successful training and often requires a specific strategy. Simply pairing random articles might result in negatives that are too easy for the model to distinguish. Your `generate_neg_sample` function implements a custom strategy for **structured negative sampling**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Function Purpose:**\n",
        "This function iterates through each item in the input DataFrame (`df`) and attempts to find a *different* item to form a negative pair with it. It aims to create negative examples that are not just random, but potentially from related categories or different text types, making the learning task more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it Works (Negative Sampling Strategy):**\n",
        "\n",
        "For each item processed from your input DataFrame (let's call the text from this item `post_1`), the function randomly selects a potential source for its corresponding negative sample (`post_2`) based on two criteria extracted from your data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Category:** Should `post_2` come from the *same* category as `post_1` or a *different* category?\n",
        "2.  **Text Type:** Assuming your DataFrame has columns for original and potentially generated text (like 'gpt'), should `post_2` be of the *same* text type (original or GPT) as `post_1`, or the *other* text type?\n",
        "\n",
        "This combination defines 4 different \"modes\" of sampling, which are chosen randomly (`randint(1,4)`) for each negative pair generated:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Mode 1:** Sample `post_2` from the **same category** as `post_1`, using the **original** text from that item.\n",

        "    * **Crucially for this seminar:** It then applies a **sampling step**, selecting a limited number (up to 10,000 positive and 10,000 negative) of examples from the loaded data. This is done to create a smaller, more manageable dataset for faster training during the session, allowing us to see results without waiting for hours on large files.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Contrastive Loss** is a widely used loss function in **Metric Learning**. Its primary goal is to train a model to learn an embedding function $f(x)$ that maps data points $x$ into a vector space such that the distance between embeddings reflects their similarity in the original data space.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Similar** data points should have **small** distances between their embeddings.\n",
        "* **Dissimilar** data points should have **large** distances between their embeddings.\n",

        "Contrastive Loss achieves this by operating on **pairs** of data points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Positive Pairs:** Pairs of data points that are considered similar or related (e.g., two views of the same object, two paraphrased sentences about the same event). The loss function encourages the distance between their embeddings to be minimal.\n",
        "2.  **Negative Pairs:** Pairs of data points that are considered dissimilar or unrelated. For these pairs, the loss function encourages the distance between their embeddings to be large, specifically **greater than a certain margin ($m$)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The loss function for a single pair $(x_i, x_j)$ with a binary label $y$ (where $y=1$ for a positive pair and $y=0$ for a negative pair) is typically defined as:\n",

        "* $m$ is the **margin**, a crucial hyperparameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In simpler terms:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* If the pair is **Positive** ($y=1$), the first term $D(f(x_i), f(x_j))$ contributes to the loss, pushing the embeddings closer.\n",
        "* If the pair is **Negative** ($y=0$), the second term $\\max(0, m - D(f(x_i), f(x_j)))$ contributes. This term is zero if the distance $D$ is already greater than or equal to the margin $m$. It only penalizes the model if the negative pair's embeddings are **too close** (closer than $m$), pushing them further apart just enough to exceed the margin.\n",
        "\n",
