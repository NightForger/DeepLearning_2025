# Deep Learning Course (2025)

## Course Description

The course is about Deep Learning, i.e. a new generation of neural network-based methods that have dramatically improved the performance of AI systems in such domains as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language analysis, reinforcement learning, bioinformatics. The course covers the basics of supervised and unsupervised deep learning and other problem statements for training deep neural models. It also covers the details of the two most successful classes of models, namely convolutional networks and models based on the attention mechanism. In terms of application, the class emphasizes computer vision and natural language analysis tasks. The course involves a significant practical component with a large number of practical assignments.
